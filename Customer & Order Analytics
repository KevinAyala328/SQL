#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

#! How many orders were placed in January?
select count (orderid)
from jansales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#2 How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
where product = "iPhone"
and length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#3 Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
select distinct acctnum
from customers c
inner join febsales  f
on c.order_id = f.orderid
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#4 Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
select distinct product, price
from jansales
order by price asc limit 1

#5 What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
(Revenue can be calculated using the number of products sold and the price of the products).
select  product, sum(quantity)*price
from jansales
group by product
 
#6 Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT product, quantity, sum(quantity)*price as Revenue
from febsales
where location = "548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101"
group by product

#7 How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
select count(c.acctnum), avg(quantity*price) as AVG
from febsales f
left join customers c
on f.orderID=c.order_id
where f.Quantity >2
and length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';
